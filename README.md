# Constituency parser for French

This work is an assignment for the MVA "Speech and NLP course".

## Use

This was tested for Python version>=3.7 (I use type annotations in my code).

You can supply the parser with an input sentence from the command line using the `--input-sent` (shorthand `-is`) optional argument:
```bash
python main.py -is "Gutenberg est soulag√© ."
```
